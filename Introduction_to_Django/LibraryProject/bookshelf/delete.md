# Delete Book

```python
from bookshelf.models import Book

# Retrieve the book first
book = Book.objects.get(title="Nineteen Eighty-Four")

# Delete the book
book.delete()

# Verify deletion
Book.objects.all()
# Expected output: <QuerySet []>
---

âœ… Key points:  
- Use `Book.objects.get()` to get the book you want to delete.  
- Call `book.delete()` to remove it from the database.  
- Verify deletion using `Book.objects.all()`.  
- Include the expected output comment so automated checks recognize it.  

If you want, I can prepare **all four CRUD Markdown files** (`create.md`, `retrieve.md`, `update.md`, `delete.md`) in one go so you can just add them and clear all checks. This saves time and ensures consistency. Do you want me to do that?
